# Finite Element Analysis and Structural Design of a Truss Bridge

## Overview
This project involves the finite element analysis (FEA) and structural design of a truss bridge using Strand7 software. The study follows Australian Standards (AS5100) to assess serviceability and ultimate limit states, ensuring structural safety and performance under various loading conditions.

## Features
- Finite element modeling of truss bridge components (primary beams, secondary beams, truss members, concrete pier columns)
- Moving load analysis (M1600) using transient dynamic simulations
- Verification of deflections, axial forces, and bending moments against AS5100 limits
- Iterative section selection for optimal material efficiency and structural integrity

## Methodology
1. **Problem Definition**: Identified loading conditions, boundary constraints, and structural components.
2. **FEA Model Development**: Created geometry, assigned material properties, and applied loads using Strand7.
3. **Analysis & Verification**: Conducted static, dynamic, and buckling analyses to evaluate structural performance.
4. **Design Optimization**: Selected optimal beam and column sections through iterative FEM modeling and manual verification.

## Results
- Maximum bridge deflection: **13.18 mm** (below the **28.3 mm** threshold)
- Achieved **20% safety margin** in axial and bending capacities
- Ensured compliance with AS5100 for all design components

## Technologies Used
- **Software**: Strand7 (Finite Element Analysis)
- **Standards**: Australian Bridge Design Code (AS5100)
- **Programming (if applicable)**: Python/MATLAB for additional calculations
